Local Agent package

This package provides a lightweight offline agentic framework built around a
vector store, an embedding model and a local language model.  It is intended
to run entirely on your machine without any external services once the
necessary models have been downloaded.  See the ``main.py`` module for a
simple commandâ€‘line interface.
